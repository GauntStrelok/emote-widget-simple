# Emote Widget

## How to Use

### For starters...

This widget is driven by two pieces of information:
#### Client ID

This is used for twitch api authentication. Creating one is simple and is used for non-authenticating requests when not accompanied with an OAuth token. It will look something like this gn4m6kqja6gkcgt24z0pbt823rurvq
#### Channel Name
    - The name of the channel you want to pull emotes from.
    - In this example twitch channel https://www.twitch.tv/itsatreee, itsatreee is the channel name.
